# LibraryProject
 Project assignment

Dependencies: Apache commons-csv-1.8


How to run:

**Command console:**

Put library.csv and LibraryProject.jar in the same folder. 
If you copied the project they are already.

Make sure you have no white spaces in your pathfile, it don't work for me atleast on win 10.

If you are not in the current directory while executing next command the program can't find library.csv
1. cd <filepath-to-project>\n
2. java -jar <filepath\LibraryProject.jar>

**Eclipse IDE:**

1. File
2. New -> Java Project

3. Untick boc "Use defualt location" click browse and navigate to cloned project.
4. Finish
5. Dont create

6. Open the projects Main.class and right click and choose Run-as -> Java App

Program should now be running!
